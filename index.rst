Introduction (this was all done by Piotr!)
=============================
**Mapel** (map of elections) is a python package that serves for drawing map of elections. It is a testbed of elections to be used
for various election-related experiments such as testing algorithms or estimating the frequency of a given phenomenon. If you want to run en experiment on a large variaty of elections then mapel is for you!

For more details please look at:

    Szufa,  S.,  Faliszewski,  P.,  Skowron,  P.,  Slinko,  A.,  Talmon,  N.:  Drawing  a  map of elections in the space of statistical cultures. In: Proceedings of AAMAS-2020, to appear.


Installation
-----------------------------
::

    pip install mapel


Import
-----------------------------
::

    import mapel


Test
-----------------------------
If everthing was correctly downloaded and imported then after writing the following command:
::

    mapel.test()

the program should print "Welcome to Mapel!".


Functionalities
=============================
In this section we describe main functionalities of mapel.

Print the map of elections
-----------------------------
**print_2d** function is printing a two dimensional embedding of all the elections from a given experiment.
::

    mapel.print_2d(exp_name, num_elections=800, main_order="", num_winners=0,  winners_order="positionwise_approx_cc", values="default", coloring="purple", angle=0,  mask=False, metric="positionwise", saveas="map_2d") 

exp_name
  : obligatory, string; name of the experiment.
  
num_winners
  : optional, int; number of winners of greedy CC to be marked.
  
winners_order
  : optional, string, name of the file that contains the order in which the winners should appear.
  
num_elections
  : optional, int, number of points to be printed.
  
main_order
  : optional, string; name of the file that contains the order in which the points should appear.
  
values
  : optional, string; name of the file that contains alpha values. The file should be in *?exp_name?/controllers/advanced/* folder.
  
coloring
  : optional, string; color in which all the points should appear (use this only if *values* is not equall to *default*). If set to "intervals" then it will color all points from [0.8,1] red, [0.6,0.8) orange, [0.4,0.6) yellow, [0.2,0.4) green, [0,0.2) blue.
  
angle
  : optional, float; rotate the image by *angle*.
    
mask
  : optional, bool; mark all families on the map (only for *example_100_100*).".
  
metric
  : optional, string; name of the metric.
  
saveas
  : optional, string; name of the saved file.


Print the matrix with distances
-----------------------------
**print_matrix** function is printing an array with average distances between each family of elections from a given experiment.

::

    mapel.print_matrix(exp_name, scale=1., metric="positionwise", saveas="matrix")

exp_name
  : obligatory, string; name of the experiment.
  
scale
  : optional, string; multiply all the values by *scale*.
   
metric
  : optional, string; name of the metric.
  
saveas
  : optional, string; name of the saved file.


Print the correlation between a given parameter and the average distance from IC.
-----------------------------
**print_param_vs_distance** function is printing an array with average distances between each family of elections from a given experiment. For now it works only with original example_100_100.

::

    mapel.print_param_vs_distance(exp_name, values="", scale="none", metric="positionwise", saveas="correlation")

exp_name
  : obligatory, string; name of the experiment.
  
values
  : obligatory, string; name of the file that contains param values. The file should be in *?exp_name?/controllers/advanced/* folder.
  
scale
  : optional, string; scale your param values with "log" or "loglog".
  
metric
  : optional, string; name of the metric.
 
saveas
  : optional, string; name of the saved file.


Prepare SOC files
-----------------------------
**prepare_approx_cc_order** funtion serves for preparing elections in soc format in approx_cc order. This function is just coping files from *soc_original* and pasting them in an order from winners *?exp_name?/results/winners/?metric?_approx_cc.txt*. 

::

    mapel.prepare_approx_cc_order(exp_name, metric="positionwise")

exp_name
  : obligatory, name of the experiment.
 
metric
  : optional, string, name of the metric.
  
  
Experiments
=============================
The mapel package contains 6 precomomputed experiments. All of them based on a mixture of 800 election from 30 different  models: 

- 30x(each), Impartial Culture, Single Crossing, SPOC, Single Peaked (by Walsh), Single Peaked (by Conitzer),
- 30x(each) Euclidean: 1D Interval, 2D Square, 3D Cube, 5D Cube, 10D Cube 20D Cube, 2D Sphere, 3D Sphere, 5D Sphere,  
- 30x(each) Urn Model with the following parameter: 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01 
- 20x(each) Mallows with the following parameter: 0.999, 0.99, 0.95, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001

They differ only in the number of candidates.

- Experiment 1: 100 voters, 100 candidates; exp_name: **example_100_100**
- Experiment 2: 100 voters, 20 candidates; exp_name: **example_100_20**
- Experiment 3: 100 voters, 10 candidates; exp_name: **example_100_10**
- Experiment 4: 100 voters, 5 candidates; exp_name: **example_100_5**
- Experiment 5: 100 voters, 4 candidates; exp_name: **example_100_4**
- Experiment 6: 100 voters, 3 candidates; exp_name: **example_100_3**

Examples
=============================

Simple examples of use. Just type the following commands in python and enjoy the results.


::

    mapel.print_2d("example_100_100", values="hb_time", mask=True)
   
::  

    mapel.print_2d("example_100_100", mask=True, saveas="awesome") 
    
::

     mapel.print_2d("example_100_20", num_winners=50, winners_order="positionwise_approx_cc")
    
::  

    mapel.print_matrix("example_100_10", scale=0.3)


Your own (simple) experiment
-----------------------------
Imagine that you want to run your own experiment. For example you want to check wheter similar elections have the same size after compression or not. You zip all the elections from *?exp_name?/elections/soc_original/*. You check their sizes, and now you would like to print the map, where the *alpha* of each point is proportional to its color. 

First should normilize the values so all of them will fall into [0,1] interval. Then you should put the value with those values in *?exp_name?/controllers/advanced*. One value per line -- where the first lines is corresponding with the first election and so on and so forth. If you are not sure about the format please look at *?exp_name?/controllers/advanced/zip_size.txt* file.

Let us assume that you run your experiment for example_100_100. If you want to print a map you just need to type::

    mapel.print_2d("example_100_100", values="zip_size", mask=True, coloring="intervals")
    
We have chosen coloring="intervals" because in this case such coloring is more informative. And if we would like the see the correlation of zip_sizes and the average distance from IC elections we should type::

    mapel.print_param_vs_distance("example_100_100", values="zip_size")


Your own (complex) experiment
-----------------------------
If you want to run an experiment that is problematic time-wise and you want to run it only for a small amount of elections, we suggest you use *prepare_approx_cc_order* function to prepare the elections in approx_cc order and then run the experiment for first (for example top 50) elections from *?exp_name?/elections/soc_?metric?_approx_cc/*. If you are chossing this option rember to set the value of *main_order* to *?metric?_approx_cc*.

We do not precompute those soc files because it would have doubled the size of the package.
    
    
Extras
=============================

Controllers
-----------------------------
The whole description of an experiment is kept in *?exp_name?/controllers/basic/map.txt". Before editing this file make a safe copy. The content looks as follows::

    number_of_voter

    number_of_candidates

    number_of_families

    first_family_size, first_family_code, first_family_param, first_family_color, first_family_alpha, first_family_label

    second_family_size, second_family_code, second_family_param, second_family_color, second_family_alpha, second_family_label

    ...

    last_family_size, family_code, family_param, family_color, family_alpha, family_label


If you want to hide a given family and do not print it just put '#' at the begging of a that family line::

    #that_family_size, that_family_code, that_family_param, that_family_color, that_family_alpha, that_family_label

You can hide many families at the same time.


Matrix with distances
-----------------------------
If you want to print just several selected families of elections or change the order in which they appear you should go to the file:  "*?exp_name?/controllers/basic/matrix.txt*". There a is list of names of all the families of elections. The number of families and their order can be change and will influence the *mapel.print_matrix()* function.

SOC files
-----------------------------
Definition of the soc format can be found here: http://www.preflib.org/data/format.php#soc
